# Student Stress Factors & Prediction — Data Mining Project

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes **student stress levels** using a real-world dataset of 1,100 students with 21 variables describing psychological, academic, environmental, and social factors.

The main goals are to:

- Clean and prepare the dataset  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key patterns  
- Answer a set of **research questions** about student stress  
- Build a **machine learning classifier** to predict high-stress students

This repository is part of a CMPE 255 Data Mining course project at San Jose State University.
